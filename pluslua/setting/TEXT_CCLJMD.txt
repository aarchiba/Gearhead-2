They didn't see this coming. HAZ! Ash-filthy idiots.
You'd think they would have known that their own technology
could be used against them. They probably didn't even think
of using it in this way. HAZ, indeed.
  
Still, this is no time to relax. If they find me again I will be
in no condition to resist, and my research is yet unfinished. I
only hope I live long enough to see it through.

Crossing the featureless void between stars must be incredibly
lonely. Each adult Exorg carries within itself a number of symbiotes
which act as companions, guardians, and servitors. They feed on
solar energy and are for all practical purposes immortal. Forever
is a long time.
  
Among the Exorg there is no distinction between their tools and
their selves; they represent the pinnacle of cybernetic co-evolution.
Perhaps they would see things differently. Maybe this is as far
as a mere human is capable of imagining, even in my current state.
  
I wonder how they will feel as they watch the human race go
extinct.

With each day I feel my knowledge growing and sanity slipping away.
It's best not to dwell on the sanity; I am turning into a machine.
Soon I will be a creature of the earth, like a rabbit or a doorknob.
The work must go on but after I cease to exist they must still not
find my brain. Concentrate on what is important.
  
Maybe I should up my dosage. HAZ!

I believe that it is time to move on. This cave is too small.
The children are starting to complain, and they've grown so
big while I've been here. Soon it will be necessary to take
the risk. REMEMBER: bring the weapons and the records, and leave
the field on in case we ever need to come back.
