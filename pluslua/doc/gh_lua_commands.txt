*********************************
***   Using  Gears  in  Lua   ***
*********************************

A gear is a game structure. In Lua all gears are objects with an entry in the
gh[] table. Whenever a gear is referenced in relation to Lua, it's this object
that I'm talking about.

All gear objects contain a pointer to the game structure they're attached to.
In general you should never use this pointer. If you need to record the
identity of a gear (say, to remember which lancemate you promised the cake to)
then you should use the NarrativeID instead.

Given a pointer or a NarrativeID, the gear object can be found in the gh[]
table.

Persistant variables should be stored inside a gear object's v table. The
contents of this table are written to disk when the game is saved; variables
stored elsewhere will be lost between sessions. Legal data types are numbers,
strings, boolean, and tables of those types.
