		Msg1_2 <This party is so painfully boring... Perhaps my spirits could be lifted if I had someone worthy to dance with. How about you?>
		CMsg1_2 <ifNPCMelancholy Accept>
		Msg1_3 <I have been waiting here a long time for someone to dance with... perhaps you would do. Shall we dance?>

		CMsg1_4 <ifNPCPassionate Accept>
		Msg2 <This party is so awfully boring...>
		Msg2_1 <The music and the food are both good, but I wish there were something for me to do.>
		CMsg2_1 <ifNPCCheerful Accept>
		Msg2_2 <What a cruel world this is, in which the beautiful must be made to suffer so much. This party is so excrutiatingly boring...>

		Msg3_1 <I'll find a dance partner who is worthy of my beauty. I'm sure of it.>
		CMsg3_1 <ifNPCCheerful Accept>
		Msg3_2 <The curse of beauty is to be forever alone. Though all of these people may want to dance with me, they are too awestruck to ask.>

		Msg7 <It's possible... If you meet anyone looking for a partner, send them my way.>
		Msg8 <Just so you know, I prefer women as well... but to dance alone is such an injustice.>
