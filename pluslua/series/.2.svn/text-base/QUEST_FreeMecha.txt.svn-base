%%
%% At the beginning of the game, there should be a chance for an enterprising
%% young character to earn a free mecha. Lazy and old characters should also be
%% able to get one. That's what these quests are for.
%%
%% If there's an NPC associated with this quest, he should be placed in the
%% Cavalier's Club, so the PC can find him easily.
%%
%% The free mecha should be generated using renown 15. In the case of having
%% to recover the mecha from a dungeon, a custom mecha with 2 modification
%% points may be given.
