%% Contains prop collections.

% To include a superprop in a scene, you need to include a SuperProp request gear.
% Attach a request to this gear telling what kind of superprop you want to add. For
% instance, to add an enemy fortress, add the following to the scene:
%
%  SuperProp
%  requires <*Fortress>
%

%% *FORTRESS Props
%%  Team 1 = Support Buildings; at least one
%%  Team 2 = Defense Buildings; maybe none
%% No fortress should be larger than 6x6.
