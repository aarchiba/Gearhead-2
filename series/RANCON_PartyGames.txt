		Msg5_1 <Not exciting? That's impossible. Maybe you just don't want to talk to me...>
		Msg5_2 <Maybe you don't think it's exciting, but it's certainly more interesting than my life...>

		Msg6_1 <I was born around here, went to school, worked at some odd jobs... Wow, I can't believe that you're talking to me!>
		Msg6_2 <There's not much to tell about me, honestly, but I'm thrilled that you'd even ask!>
		Msg7 <No, you wouldn't be interested...>
		Msg7_1 <I don't think you'd find my life story interesting... and I don't know any rumors either...>
		Msg8 <Wow. That's simply amazing. You'll have to tell me more of your adventures someday.>
		Msg8_1 <So it all really did happen? Cool. You're fantastic.>
		Msg8_2 <You mean, that all really happened? Wow. You're even cooler than I thought!>
		Msg9 <Either you're lying or you're just not a very good storyteller. Either way, I'm going to go get some nachos.>
		Msg9_1 <You know, you could've just told me honestly about your adventures and I would've thought that was swell. You didn't have to go making up stuff.>
		Msg9_2 <I don't know... Your story just doesn't seem believable to me...>
		Msg10 <Hah! Well, anyways, it was a good story... We'll have to talk again some time.>
		Msg10_1 <Well, it doesn't matter if it was true or not, because it was a good story. Thanks for telling it to me. We'll have to chat again someday.>
		Msg10_2 <That's quite a story. Even if it wasn't entirely true, I'm glad you told it to me!>
		Msg11 <I knew it.>
		Msg11_1 <I figured that you weren't telling the truth, but I'm not a cavalier myself so I had no way to be sure.>
		Msg11_2 <Honestly, you've never had that kind of exciting adventure, have you?>
		Prompt1 <I've defeated a dozen enemies at a time!>
		Prompt1_1 <My name is feared across the solar system.>
		Prompt1_2 <To my enemies, I am the angel of death.>
