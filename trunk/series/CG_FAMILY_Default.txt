% FAMILY HISTORY FILE

%  The "V" of a family gear tells how many "Jobs" it contributes to the
%  PC's creation. Each job should be indicated in the family desc as a #.
%  It will be replaced with the job name at runtime.

% The family context is applied first, so even if no changes are intended
% it includes a "blank" personal context.
