%
%  Moods affect the plots loaded by cities. Here's a brief explanation
%  of how they work.
%
%  The Mood definition takes as its parameter the number of plots which
%  may be attached to this mood. Normally, each city can have up to ten
%  attached plots at any one time, but a mood will increase this number
%  by the provided amount.
%
%  The REQUIRES attribute is compared to a city's Scene Context to
%  determine whether or not this mood is appropriate. The Scene Context
%  includes the city's type, terrain, context, designation, faction
%  designation, persona type, and world designation.
%
%  The Mood's TYPE attribute is added to the city's TYPE attribute.
%
%  The Mood's PLOT_TYPE attribute determines what sort of plots will be
%  associated with this mood. The normal plot type is *GENERAL, but moods
%  can use custom types.
%
%  Custom plots associated with a mood should be stored in a file
%  named PLOT_MOOD_[custom label].
%
%  The Mood's ELEMENTs are selected just as they are for plots.
%
%  The UPDATE script is called when the mood is initialized. It should
%  generally set an initialization counter and record a news message.
%
%  The MSG_x strings act as a meme; NPCs in the city will say these lines
%  for as long as the mood is in effect.
%
%  MoodTimeLimit is set automatically for these moods; no need to define it.
%
%  Substitute strings:
%    %me_X%		Element X's ID
%    %me_nameX%		Element X's Name
%    %city%		The city where this mood is installed
