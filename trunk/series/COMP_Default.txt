% STATE OF STORY DESCRIPTION
%  The state of the story is determined by both the "context" attribute held in
%  the story and by certain variables which are determined when it's time to
%  generate a new component. These variables could include:
%  - The existence and nature of the palette entries
%  - The alleigance of the current location with either the PC's faction
%    or the palette enemy faction

% The palette entries are:
%	STAT_XRP_EnemyChar = 1;			{ E: }
%	STAT_XRP_EnemyFac = 2;			{ F: }
%	STAT_XRP_PCFac = 3;			{ P: }
%	STAT_XRP_PlotStateNPC = 4;		{ M: }
%	STAT_XRP_TargetNPC = 5;			{ T: }
%	STAT_XRP_ComponentScene = 6;		{ S: }
%	STAT_XRP_EpisodeScene = 7;		{ L: }
%	STAT_XRP_TargetItem = 8;		{ I: }
