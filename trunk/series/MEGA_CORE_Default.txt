%% *:CS_BASE_PlunderShip
%%
%% The PC will plunder a ship, hopefully belonging to the enemy. This component
%% does not contain any story development of its own. Instead, it will set a
%% number of triggers which the calling subplot can use to activate events.
%% I am doing things this way because the plundering scenario is extremely
%% complex and duplicating it for different story contexts would be tough.
%%
%% Signals sent by this plot:
%%  .%id%_%plotid%_GoAttackShip		The PC has entered the ship exterior
%%					scene. Check the hostility of Team 2 to
%%					see whether or not peaceful entry has
%%					been achieved.
%%  .%id%_%plotid%_GoBoardShip		The PC has snuck on board the ship.
%%					Again, check the hostility of Team 2 to
%%					find out if the entry was peaceful.
%%  .%id%_%plotid%_GoPlunderOK		The PC has successfully plundered the
%%					ship. Dole out loot and consequences
%%					appropriate.
%%  .%id%_%plotid%_GoPlunderBad		The PC has captured the ship, but
%%					screwed up on the plundering... probably
%%					by blowing everything to heck.
%%  .%id%_%plotid%_GoPlunderFail	The PC didn't plunder jack.

%% PARAM1: The outdoors scene for the encounter
%% PARAM2: The encounter to be used for the ship; contains the name of the
