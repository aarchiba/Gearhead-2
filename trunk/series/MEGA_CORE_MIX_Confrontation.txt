%% *:CS_MIX_Confrontation Content
%%     &NoDerailment   May not derail the plot; just straight combat please!
%%
%%  Y'know how to get more randomness in your random story generator? Mix things
%%  up a bit.
%%
%%  The core story enemy is doing something. The PC is trying to prevent it.
%%  Now, the two of them are gonna fight. It doesn't really matter what kind of
%%  fight we're dealing with- whatever's going on, we can work in some character
%%  development.
%%
%%  At the start of combat, this subplot will be activated.
%%  The combat encounter can then send the following triggers, both of which
%%  must have scripts in this subplot:
%%
%%    .%id%_%plotid%_GoCombatWin
%%    .%id%_%plotid%_GoCombatLoss
%%
%%  The confrontation will send back the following triggers:
%%
%%    .%id%_%plotid%_GoWin
%%    .%id%_%plotid%_GoLoss
%%
%%  The combat encounter requires the following teams:
%%
%%    Enemies
%%    EnemyNPC
%%
%%  Note that this subplot may completely derail combat by issuing a RETURN
%%  command. The parent subplot must wait for one of the above responses before
%%  concluding.
%%
%%  An encounter to which a confrontation has been attached automatically
%%  becomes a MAIN COURSE.
%%
%% PARAM1: The Enemy NPC, who should be in the encounter scene + ready to fight
%% PARAM2: The outdoors scene where the encounter is
