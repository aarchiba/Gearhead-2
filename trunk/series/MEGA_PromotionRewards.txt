%% These components contain faction reward stuff.
%%
%% Reward components have to check the PC's RENOWN. Renown must be greater
%% than RewardRank * 10 or the PC will get a cash prize instead of whatever
%% super reward was being planned. Certain factions may add an additional
%% test; for instance, a police faction may only give the premium reward
%% if the PC's Lawfulness is also greater than RewardRank * 10.
%%
%% Reward components also have to check to make sure the level being
%% rewarded is in the range 1..8; for faction level 9 and above, a cash
%% prize is all that the PC can get.
%%
%%  PARAM 1 = The NPC to give the reward.
