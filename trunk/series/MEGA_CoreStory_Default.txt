%% *CS_Duel Content
%%
%%
%% The PC is about to duel somebody as part of the core story.
%%
%% The parent plot sets the plot status to this layer's ID when ready.
%% This component should move the opponent from its current location to the
%% contest location at update, and then move the opponent back to its
%% original location at the end of the battle.
%%
%% Param1: The Challenger
%% Param2: The Challenger's home scene, for the purpose of this component
%% Param3: The outdoor scene where the duel will take place
%%
%% NEEDED SCRIPTS: To deal with the ending, the parent plot must define two
%% scripts:
%% 	.%id%_%plotid%_GoWin
%% 	.%id%_%plotid%_GoLose
%% %id% is the ID of the duel layer; so, if it was generated as subplot 1,
%% the calling plot would use %id1%.
%% Please note that it is possible this component will not exit to either of
%% the above labels, if a complete derailment of the story takes place.
