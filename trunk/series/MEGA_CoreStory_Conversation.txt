%%

%%	+Fin	To find information
%%
%% Why split these off into a subplot, rather than just writing them as basic
%% plots? Because all of these conversations should be encounterable under
%% two separate circumstances: Either the PC's task is to speak with the NPC,
%% or the NPC contacts the PC of his/her own volition.
