%% This file contains "toppers"- quests which exist only to conclude preceding quests.
%% A topper must immediately (or pretty close to immediately) set the QuestStatus to
%% a negative number, without invoking any successors. It may, however, trigger a
%% complication subquest.

%% The PC helped the NPC with something. Now the NPC will say thanks. This
%% quest must end with a -1 result, though it can throw a subquest if you
%% really want.
%%
%% The NPC's persona must have a .%id%_GoInit script, which sets the QuestStatus
%% and maybe activates the subquest.
