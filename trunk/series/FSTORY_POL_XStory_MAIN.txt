	%% Here's how it works:
	%% - The police faction loads this story
	%% - This story loads a "controller" plot.
	%%   The controller plot contains the mission-giving NPC.
	%% - The controller sets the context for the story and
	%%   requests a component check.
	%% - Thereafter, the components are updated independantly
	%%   of the controller.
	%% - If the mission-giving NPC dies while the PC is working
	%%   on this story, a replacement officer is loaded to deal
	%%   with forensics and rewards and stuff.
