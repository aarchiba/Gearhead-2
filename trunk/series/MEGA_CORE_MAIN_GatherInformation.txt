%% This script tells the PC about the situation, setting up the rest of this
%% subplot. The SubPlotID must be set separately.
%%
%% When this subplot concludes, it sets one of the following triggers:
%%  .%id%_%plotid%_GoWin
%%  .%id%_%plotid%_GoLoss
%%
%% This is a MAIN COURSE subplot. Favored by: POLIT, MEDIA, ACADE
%%

%%  Param1: The NPC who will tell the PC about the situation.
%%          After introducing the component, this NPC will serve no further purpose
