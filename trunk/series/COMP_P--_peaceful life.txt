		Msg1_7 <My family is originally from Luna. My homeworld needs me... There's a lot of problems there now. Strong leadership is needed to unite the people and rebuild the colonies. That's why I've decided to join the Aegis Mecha Corps.>
		CMsg1_7 <ifNPCHeroic Accept>
		Msg1_8 <I think I told you once that my family's from Luna... Well, I've decided to go back there and join Aegis Overlord. Soon Luna will be the greatest superpower in the solar system, and I want to be a part of that.>
		CMsg1_8 <ifNPCVillainous Accept>

		Msg2 <I have to. It is my destiny, as one of Lunar blood. The Unification War threatened to destroy society. Only Aegis can unite Luna and restore civilization to the birthworld.>
		Msg2_1 <This isn't about me. It's about Luna, my fellow citizens there... Aegis is the only power with enough strength to unify and protect the colonies. That's why I have to join them.>
		CMsg2_1 <ifNPCSociable Accept>
		Msg2_2 <Everybody dies sometime.>
		CMsg2_2 <ifNPCShy Accept>
		Msg2_3 <Don't be so morbid... I have no intention of dying. Why can't you be happy for me?>
		CMsg2_3 <ifNPCCheerful Accept>
		Msg2_4 <Death holds no fear for me... What is important isn't the length of one's life but what one accomplishes in it.>
		CMsg2_4 <ifNPCMelancholy Accept>
		Msg2_5 <And if I stayed here I could be killed accidentally crossing the street. I'm not going to worry about it.>
		CMsg2_5 <ifNPCEasygoing Accept>
		Msg2_6 <To sit idly by and do nothing would be worse than death. I choose to do something important with my life, and Aegis is the best means to that goal.>
		CMsg2_6 <ifNPCPassionate Accept>
		Msg2_7 <My life means nothing next to the lives of my fellow Lunar citizens. Aegis is the only faction with enough power to unite and protect Luna. Although I don't agree with everything they've done, joining them is the best thing I can do.>
		CMsg2_7 <ifNPCHeroic Accept>
		Msg2_8 <In a few years it'll be dangerous to not be a part of Luna. Aegis Overlord is quickly gaining power. Soon, not even Earth will be able to stand against it.>
		CMsg2_8 <ifNPCVillainous Accept>

		Msg3 <You don't understand what really happens on Luna, all you know are the lies spread by the media. Aegis Overlord is the true inheritor of Pax Europa. They are the only force powerful enough to unite and protect Luna.>
		Msg3_1 <I've weighed all the facts and decided that Aegis is the only power with the strength to unite and defend Luna from all of its enemies, both external and internal. You should be more supportive of your friends.>
		CMsg3_1 <ifNPCSociable Accept>
		Msg3_2 <You obviously don't know anything about what really happens on Luna. Don't believe the Alliance propaganda.>
		CMsg3_2 <ifNPCShy Accept>
		Msg3_3 <They're not as bad as the Alliance propaganda makes out. Really, if you knew what was really happening on Luna right now you'd agree with me.>
		CMsg3_3 <ifNPCCheerful Accept>
		Msg3_4 <They are... but on Luna, they're the only ones with the power to unite and protect all the colonies. In order to serve my homeworld I have no choice but to join Aegis.>
		CMsg3_4 <ifNPCMelancholy Accept>
		Msg3_5 <It's easy to criticize things when you don't know all the facts. Everything Aegis has done has been to protect its citizens.>
		CMsg3_5 <ifNPCEasygoing Accept>
		Msg3_6 <All governments sometimes have to do harsh things to protect their citizens. Name me one country that hasn't... Aegis is no different than the L5 Alliance, and if truth be told is a whole lot better than the Federation of Earth.>
		CMsg3_6 <ifNPCPassionate Accept>
		Msg3_7 <There have been some... mistakes. I admit that. But in the end, Aegis is the only force capable of uniting and protecting Luna. Joining them is the right thing to do.>
		CMsg3_7 <ifNPCHeroic Accept>
		Msg3_8 <Oh, please. Morality is a lie designed to protect the weak. In the real world it's the powerful who survive. It's better to live than to die, isn't it? I don't intend to throw my future away.>
		CMsg3_8 <ifNPCVillainous Accept>

		Msg4 <I'm very excited about it! Aegis has done so many wonderful things for Luna... They ended the Unification War, established peace, and even made the interdome trains run on time.>
