		Msg3 <You really shouldn't dawdle. The administration of Theles Spinner is a serious business... it makes me glad that I'm simply a gardener.>
		Msg4 <My, but that was the wrong answer. Wilted flowers must be pruned, before they infect the rest of the garden. I'm so sorry.>
		Msg5 <This is the fourth level of Theles Spinner, the home of the supreme technocrats. I am merely a humble gardener. My purpose is to keep everything running.>

		Msg7 <Leaders such as these, giants if I may say, cannot be expected to work together under normal circumstances. Luckily we've found a way to let them share. They are dreaming.>
		Msg8 <Yes, dreaming. Their subconscious minds send orders to the levels below. If their orders result in energy profit for the colony, their brains are granted exquisite pleasure. If they result in energy loss... well, let's not mention that.>
		Msg9 <Why, to add you to the garden, of course! You have proven that you belong here.>

		Msg12 <Don't be so hasty. Take a look around the garden, see how peaceful they are. Make your decision then.>
