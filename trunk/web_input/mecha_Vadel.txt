The Vadel is often cited as the first battroid of the modern age. In
NT92 the first Vadels were built one at a time by a family company
operating out of a single workshop. The company grew rapidly, and mass
production began in NT110.

In the seven decades of Vadel Incorporated's history there have been
forty redesigns of the basic model. It has been a constant favorite of
both military and arena pilots. In addition to mecha, Vadel Incorporated
produces engines and thrust systems for other companies.

It is widely believed that Vadel Incorporated is working on a new model
to replace the current "AD-2x" series. The release of this version will
likely coincide with the company's 70th anniversary in NT162.
