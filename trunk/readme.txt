Welcome to GearHead-2. Although this game is in an early stage of development,
comments and bug reports are welcome. Take a look around at what's being done
and let me know if you think I'm on the right track.

GH2 is released under the terms of the LGPL; see license.txt for more details.

For help with the game you can visit either the GearHead wiki, or the forum:
  Wiki:   http://gearhead.chaosforge.org/wiki/
  Forum:  http://gearhead.chaosforge.org/forum/

To run the SDL version you need to have SDL, SDL_Image, SDL_ttf, and
OpenGL installed. The precompiled Windows releases come with all needed
dlls.

To compile the game you need FreePascal, available from www.freepascal.org.
To compile with graphics you also need the Jedi-SDL package, available from
here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/jedi-sdl/

Just type "ppc386 gearhead" and the program should compile.
To get the ASCII version, type "ppc386 -dASCII gearhead".

If you get a blue screen and no graphics, try uncommenting Revert_Slower_Safer
in gearhead.cfg.

I hope you have fun with the program.
