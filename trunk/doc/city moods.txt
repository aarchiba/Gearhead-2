Moods are wonderous things. Basically they modify the plots which load in their
attached cities. How do they do this? Several ways:
- Moods alter the city's TYPE, thereby causing differnt plots to be loaded
- Moods may load plots of types other than *GENERAL
- Moods may have their own set of elements, like stories

	{ CITYMOOD DEFINITION }
	{  G = GG_CityMood     }
	{  S = Undefined       }
	{  V = Number of attached plots }
	{ A mood may also have TYPE and a PLOT_TYPE string attributes. The first modifies the }
	{ type of the city to which the mood is attached. The second determines what sort of plot }
	{ will be loaded by this mood; the default value is *GENERAL. }
	{ The ControllerID for a mood is assigned automatically. }


Elements 1 through 9 add their context to the plot request.

If a mood is defined as a prefab element, it may grab elements from the plot
or story which generated it. Positive indicies indicate the plot, while negative
indicies will grab directly from the story.

When a mood is inserted, its time limit is set (ComTime + Value, if nonzero) and its
UPDATE script is called.

String Substitutions:
	%city%				The name of the city
	%me_name1% ... %me_name20%	Mood element names
	%me_1% ... %me_20%		Mood Element IDs

Moods also function as memes for the cities in which they are installed. To do this,
include a MSG <> block in the mood. Make sure to include a good variety of phrases
since unlike regular memes, moods don't have a maximum view limit.
