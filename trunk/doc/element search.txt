**************************
***   PLACE  STRINGS   ***
**************************

The elements of plots, subplots, quests, and random scene content can be
positioned in the adventure by using place strings.

PLACE(n) <[~](Destination Slot) [(team name)] [team data]>

If the destination slot is preceded by a ~. the element will be placed in the same
scene as the destination rather than in the destination itself.

A subplot can assign a place string to an element it inherits.

If (Destination Slot) is "/", and we're dealing with either a quest or
a rancon, the element will be frozen in a special holding zone and will
need to be moved by the script. This does not work with regular plots,
where prefab components without a defined place are left as invcoms of
the plot itself.
