A megaplot is a plot with extras.

*************************
** Requesting SubPlots **
*************************

A subplot may be requested by adding a string describing the subplot.

SUBPLOT[n] <[*SubPlot Type] Param1 Param2 ...>

Basically it's the same as adding subquests. Up to 8 subplots may
be defined, and they all must be numbered.


*************************
** Replacement Strings **
*************************

%plotid%	The Plot ID
%id%		The individual layer ID of this component.
%1%..%10%	The element IDs
%name1%..%name10%	The element names
%id1%..%id8%	Layer IDs of subplots



- Better self-initialization
	- Elements moved to correct locations
	- Replacement strings
- Automatically handled time limits
- Key character indication/cleanup on death
- Plot extensions
	- Extensions may add further extensions recursively
- Plot state, rumors can be keyed to current state
- May add metascenes, and merge additional MS info
	- Map features may be indicated as element home

Design Flow

- Add extension
  - Assign layer ID
  - Select candidate
    - Copy Elements, Match to adventure
    - Add sub-extensions
    - Repeat until everything initialized OK
  - Delink candidate from adventure and return - leave stub in place to defend NPC selections
- Remove the stubs
- Assemble the plot

Assembly Flow

- Do all replacement strings %1%..%10% etc
- Merge element lists
- Merge personas
- Merge plot scripts
- Merge Metascenes
- Move gears as required
