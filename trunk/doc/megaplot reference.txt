A megaplot is a plot with extras.

*************************
** Requesting SubPlots **
*************************

A subplot may be requested by adding a string describing the subplot.

SUBPLOT[n] <[*SubPlot Type] Param1 Param2 ...>

Basically it's the same as adding subquests. Up to 8 subplots may
be defined, and they all must be numbered.

If this plot is based on a story, the story context will be used.
The element context for all parameters will be used.

*************************
** Replacement Strings **
*************************

%plotid%	The Plot ID
%id%		The individual layer ID of this component.
%threat%	The difficulcy rating of this plot, measured as Renown
%1%..%10%	The element IDs
%name1%..%name10%	The element names
%id1%..%id8%	Layer IDs of subplots
%e1%..%e10%	Element Index of subplot element

*************************
*** Element Placement ***
*************************

You can move elements automatically by defining a "PLACE[n]" string for them.

Place[n] <[~](Destination Index)  ((Team Name)) (team data)>

The destination index is the element number where where the gear should be moved.

If a team name is indicated in parenthesis (), this will be used.

If the first character in the place attribute is a ~, the gear will be placed
in the scene of the requested element rather than the element itself.

If being moved to a metascene, if there's a map feature with the designation
"HOME [index]", where [index] is the Element Index of this element, it will be placed
there as mini map component 1. Note that the Index here refers to the master plot
index, not the subplot index; use %e1%..%e10% to set it.



- Better self-initialization
	- Elements moved to correct locations
	- Replacement strings
- Automatically handled time limits
- Key character indication/cleanup on death
- Plot extensions
	- Extensions may add further extensions recursively
- Plot state, rumors can be keyed to current state
- May add metascenes, and merge additional MS info
	- Map features may be indicated as element home

Design Flow

- Add extension
  - Assign layer ID
  - Select candidate
    - Copy Elements, Match to adventure
    - Add sub-extensions
    - Repeat until everything initialized OK
  - Delink candidate from adventure and return - leave stub in place to defend NPC selections
- Remove the stubs
- Assemble the plot

Assembly Flow

- Do all replacement strings %1%..%10% etc
- Merge element lists
- Merge personas
- Merge plot scripts
- Merge Metascenes
- Move gears as required
