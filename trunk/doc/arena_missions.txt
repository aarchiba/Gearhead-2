Arena Mode missions are stored in series\ARENAMISSION_*.txt

They are written as scenes, but may also request elements like plots.

A mission must have a "requires" SATt which describes what factions can
take it. This string can include:

- Faction type, designation
- Difficulcy rating:
	!Ex, !Hi, !Md, !Lo, !Ne
- Unspent coupons for reward missions:
	SKILL_TRAIN_MISSION, MECHA_SOURCE_MISSION

As with plots, the first invcoms of the mission will be taken as the
prefab elements. To assign a faction to a prefab NPC, use a negative
value to assign one of the elements (E1..E10 = -1..-10).

The plot string substitutions can now be used in arena missions.



****************************
***   COMBAT  MISSIONS   ***
****************************

This is the default mission type. These missions must include a *MISSION tag
in their requires attribute.


****************************
***   REWARD  MISSIONS   ***
****************************

These are difficult missions which offer special rewards. They don't appear as
often as combat missions do. Reward missions must include a *REWARD tag in their
requires attribute, and all the good rewards need a coupon as well.

Remember to spend the coupon when applying the reward at the end of the mission.


**************************
***   CORE  CAMPAIGN   ***
**************************

The context for the core campaign is stored in a SAtt in the adventure named
CORE_CONTEXT. Oooh, such nice alliteration.

The context information includes:
- The story context, stored as CORE_CONTEXT
- The context of the player faction, marked as "P:"
- The context of the enemy faction, marked as "F:"
- The difficulcy rating of the mission (!Ne..!Ex)

If KEY is requested as an element, it selects the core campaign enemy faction.

As of right now the story context contains only one thing, the propp state.
The propp states for the arena campaign are as follows:

	+P--	Initial State
	+Pin	We Want Information

	+Pha	Home under attack
	+Pls	Looking for something

	+Par	Arms Race

	+Ptf	Take the fight to them
	+Ppt	Peace Talks
	+Pfm	Fleet mobilized
	+Pew	Enemy superweapon
