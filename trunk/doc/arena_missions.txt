Arena Mode missions are stored in series\ARENAMISSION_*.txt

They are written as scenes, but may also request elements like plots.

A mission must have a "requires" SATt which describes what factions can
take it. This string can include:

- Faction type, designation
- Difficulcy rating: !Ex, !Hi, !Md, !Lo, !Ne

As with plots, the first invcoms of the mission will be taken as the
prefab elements. To assign a faction to a prefab NPC, use a negative
value to assign one of the elements (E1..E10 = -1..-10).
