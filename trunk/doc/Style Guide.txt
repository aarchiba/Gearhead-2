**************************
***   SOCIABLE  ACTS   ***
**************************

Sociable characters are conscious of society and their place in it. They share their
feelings and thoughts easily with other characters. They are loyal to their friends
and feel responsibility to their social groups. Esteem and public image are important
to them. They sometimes have difficulty keeping secrets.

Examples: Relena Peacecraft, Yumiko Star

- Asking about or expressing interest in other characters
- Volunteering information about self
- Accepting soceital obligations


*********************
***   SHY  ACTS   ***
*********************

Shy characters don't care much for society. They may feel that they don't have any
need of other people, but in any case they exist on the fringes of the social
network. They tend to be more concerned with the material rewards of their job than
with praise or the esteem of their community; because of this, shy characters can
often appear selfish. They don't share very much information about themselves.

Examples: Cloud Strife, Sylia Stingray

- Expressing disinterest in the lives of others
- "As long as I'm paid well"
- Being evasive, especially when there's no good reason to do so


**************************
***   CHEERFUL  ACTS   ***
**************************

Cheerful characters are optimists. They don't worry too much about setbacks,
instead rebounding and getting on with making things better. When speaking
they tend to avoid mentioning unpleasant things. They view life as a game
and try to have as much fun as possible.

Examples: Shiro Armada, Ed

- Saying cheerful or lighthearted things
- Remaining optimistic even in the face of defeat


****************************
***   MELANCHOLY  ACTS   ***
****************************

Melancholy characters are pessimists. They tend to talk about death, either their
own (the Emo variant) or other people's (the Charles Bronson variant). They may be
described as grumpy, irritable, or angsty. Most melancholy characters would agree
that a problem can't be entirely solved until someone dies.

Examples: Captain Harlock, Wolverine

- Making death threats, especially to noncombatants
- Sounding depressed, angsty, or bitter


***************************
***   EASYGOING  ACTS   ***
***************************

Easygoing characters don't take anything too seriously. Given the choice between
doing something the easy way or the hard way, they'd take the easy way. They are
quite willing to compromise in order to get what they want. They value comfort
and generally try to avoid conflict.

Examples: Justy Ueki Tylor, Han Solo

- Expressing reluctance to do something hard or dangerous
- Begging, whining, or making excuses
- Compromising, changing one's mind, or admitting a mistake


****************************
***   PASSIONATE  ACTS   ***
****************************

Passionate characters believe in a black and white universe with inflexible rules.
Given the choice between doing something the easy way or the hard way, they'd take
the hard way just to prove that they can. They are unwilling to compromise; they
are also unwilling to change their minds, even in the face of overwhelming evidence.
These characters admire strength and seek out conflict.

Examples: Priss, Tatewaki Kuno

- Challenging someone to a duel
- Refusing to compromise or admit a mistake
- "My honor is besmirched!"
