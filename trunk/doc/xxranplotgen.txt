EXTRA EXTRA RANDOM PLOT GENERATION

First there was random plot generation. Then there was extra-random plot generation.
So, what do I name the improved plot generator for GH2? Extra-extra-random plot
generation, of course.


The plot components are selected based on a context string provided by the governing
story. This string contains the xxran descriptors; a label telling whether the component
is to be a complication, resolution or failure; a label telling the difficulcy level;
descriptions for the xxran palette; and the PC's job.

A label preceded by a ~ is optional. It will increase the chance of this component
being selected, but doesn't have to be present.

A label preceded by a - must not be present in the story context. If it is, this
component cannot be selected.

A group of labels surrounded by parenthesis and separated by |s is an or-block. One
of the individual labels must be present and it will increase the chance of this
component being selected.

If the lable "COMMON" is included in the list, this component is more likely to
be selected.



COMPLICATION, RESOLUTION, FAILURE
  #a, #w, #l

DIFFICULCY LEVEL: EXTREME, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, NEGLIGIBLE
  !Ex, !Hi, !Md, !Lo, !Ne

NON-XXRAN PLOT CONTEXTS

The core story will have the descriptors below. A non-core story can have its own
label defined in a context SAtt. This may be used to limit certain persona fragments
and random scene content to a particular story or plot.

This label must start with a "=", may be as long as you want (as long as it's unique),
and may have several sections divided by underscores. For instance, the label "=MIL_DEFAULT"
can be used by the MILitary story DEFAULT or any of its plots.

XXRAN PALETTE

Every story that uses the xxran commands should have a standard set of elements. This
is so components can share elements between them, and also so that components can be
selected quickly without doing full element searches. The standard palette entries are:

1. Enemy Character (E:)
2. Enemy Faction (F:)
3. Target Faction (P:)*
4. Plot State NPC (N:)
5. Target NPC (T:)
6. Scene for next component (S:)
	S:meta for metascene, S:perm for perminant scene
7. Root location of current episode (L:)
8. Target Item (I:)

These labels are followed by "++" if the element exists, or "--" if the element doesn't.
In addition, the desig and context strings for each element are included. For instance,
the tag "P:cor" would indicate that the PC's faction (P:) is corporate. The tag F:AEGIS
would indicate that the enemy faction is Aegis Overlord.

In addition, the designation of the element's faction is included if appropriate.

If the element is an enemy of the PC, an "ENEMY" tag is included. If the element is
an ally of the PC, an "ALLY" tag is included.

If the element is a NPC, the relationship is also included. This may be one of "FAMILY",
"LOVER", or "FRIEND".

The job group of the PC is included as C:<job>. The available job designations are:
%%   ACADE: Academic
%%   ADVEN: Adventurer
%%   CORPO: Merchant, Corporate, White Collar
%%   CRAFT: Craftsman
%%   FAITH: Monk, Priest, etc
%%   LABOR: Skilled or unskilled labor
%%   MEDIA: Media, Performance, etc
%%   MEDIC: Medical
%%   MILIT: Military
%%   POLIT: Politician
%%   POLIC: Police
%%   THIEF: Criminal

PLOT DESCRIPTORS

The first two characters of a plot descriptor are its type. Only one label
of a given type may be used in a single description. If a second label of
the same type is added, the original label is deleted.

In plot description, optional traits ("the flavor elements") are preceded
by a ~. These are not nessecary but will increase the likelihood of this
component being selected if they're present.

The story is made up of episodes. Each episode takes place in a single city.
Each episode is made up of several components.
