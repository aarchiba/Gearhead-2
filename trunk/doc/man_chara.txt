***  MANAGING  YOUR  CHARACTER  ***
***********************************
  
 The most important command for taking care of your PC is the View
 Character interface, accessed by pressing "C". From here you can take
 care of most of your character's needs.
  
BACKPACK
  
 This option allows you to view your character's worldly goods.
 The backpack is divided into two area. The top area is your
 equipment; these are the items which your PC is currently using.
 The bottom area is your inventory; these are the items which your
 PC is carrying but isn't currently using.
  
 You can switch back and forth between inventory and equipment
 by pressing the '/' key.
  
 The backpack menu can also be accessed during exploration mode.
 Press 'i' to view your inventory, or 'e' to view your equipment.
  
VIEW INJURIES
  
 Your PC's health point total is always shown in the info window,
 but for a more detailed overview of your character's health you can
 always use the View Injuries option.
  
 If your character is moving slowly, or doesn't seem to be using one
 of his arms, come here to see if his limbs have been damaged.
  
TRAINING
  
 Spending experience points is what is good in life. From the training
 sub-menu it is possible to view all your skills, to improve them, to
 learn new skills, and once you are sufficiently advanced to even improve
 your PC's statistics.
  
 Your character will pay more for training if too many skills are known.
 The total number of skills your character can have without penalty is
 determined by the Knowledge stat.
  
FIELD HQ
  
 The Field HQ allows you to handle all of your PC's wargear. All items
 which your PC owns but which are too heavy to be carried personally
 may be viewed and edited here. See the MANAGING YOUR MECHA doc for
 more information.
  
TALENTS
 
 Talents are special things your character can do that most people
 can't. You only get a limited number of talents, so choose them
 wisely.
