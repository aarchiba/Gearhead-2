***   IMPORTANT  NOTE   ***
***************************

Quests are now covered under MegaPlots. In general, a quest will function
in the same was as a megaplot. I'm leaving this document here for a bit
until the merger gets ironed out.

...

For convenience an instance of static adventure content will be referred
to as a Quest, even though most will not follow the standard quest format
seen in most games (do foo, receive bar).

A Quest is a collection of adventure components combined with each other
and then embedded into the adventure.


QUEST FRAGMENT NAMES

A quest fragment type name must begin with an asterix, as in "*SUCCESS".

A quest fragment that begins a new subquest must begin with an asterix
and a colon, as in "*:PROVESELF".

A quest fragment name may include optional descriptors separated from
the main name by periods, as in "*:FINDMONEY.CHARITY" or "*:FINDMONEY.INVESTMENT".


ELEMENT HANDLING

Do not insert a persona fragment in the greeting of a persona! This will be megalisted
in, and mess up loads of stuff.

Rumors attached to a persona have the format "RUMOR%id% <>". When the quest status equals
ID this rumor will be used.

If "." is requested as an element, it will be the city where this story takes place.



QUEST REQUEST

   [Quest Type] [Quest Threat Rating]

A character can request one quest. A scene can request as many as wanted.
Contained in a "QUEST" string attribute of a scene.

If the Quest Threat Rating is omitted or 0, a default difficulcy rating will
be calculated based on the location of the quest relative to the PC's starting
point.

Must contain a content type preceded by a *.

The context for the content request includes the following:
- SceneContext for the city, in quotes
  - Context string, desig, type, terrain, static/dynamic, personatype, faction, world
- XXRan context for the key scene, prefixed by "S:"
  - Existence, faction, context SAtt
- XXRan context for the key character, prefixed by "C:"
  - Existence, relation to PC, faction, job context
- XXRan context for params, prefixed as "1:" through "9:"


QUEST REQUEST FROM A QUEST

[ Content Type ] [#threat] [E1] [E2] ...

Starts with the content type.

Next is an optional threat value override. If a number preceded by a hash is included,
this overrides the current difficulcy rating of this quest thread.

Next, a list of element IDs to be passed from the current fragment to the next.
Note that only 9 parameters can be passed, despite the fact that a plot may have
(as of now, anyway) up to 10 elements.


REPLACEMENT STRINGS

%id%	The layer ID of this component.
%qid%	The quest ID associated with this component.
%prev_id%	The layer ID of the parent fragment
%prev_qid%	The quest ID of the parent fragment
%scenesq_id%	The layer ID of this scene's subquest (NewScene only)
%scenesq_qid%	The quest ID of this scene's subquest (NewScene only)
%scenechar% 	The CID of the scene's key character (NewScene only)
%scenefac% 	The ID of the scene's faction (NewScene only)
%threat%	The difficulcy level of the fragment, expressed as renown.
%sktar%		An appropriate skill roll target, based on the difficulcy.
%sktar_hard%	A hard skill roll based on the difficulcy.
%1%..%10%	The element IDs
%name1%..%name10%	The element names
%s1%..%s10%	The element scenes
%id1%..%id8%	Layer IDs of subquests
%qid1%..%qid8%	Quest IDs of subquests


VALUES ASSOCIATED WITH A QUEST

Quest ID:       Every quest has a globally unique ID number.
                This number is used to determine the "plot state" of
                a given quest.
Layer ID:       Every layer in a quest has an ID number which is
                unique within the scope of the quest.

A component can set the Quest Status to either its own ID (which it should do when
initializing) or to a negative number (which means that the quest is over).

If a subquest relies on information from the parent quest, it should have a check to
make sure the parent quest is at the right state before doing anything.


REUSABLE FRAGMENTS

Most fragments are unique- once added to the adventure, they are removed from the list
and will not be used again. If a fragment has a "REUSABLE" tag in its SPECIAL string
attribute, it will be reusable over and over again.

Reusable fragments should not include any new characters.


QUEST MEMOS AND QUEST SUBMEMOS

Quest memos are stored in the adventure itself. Each quest can have one memo.
The key for a quest's memo is "MEMO_" + QuestID. After a quest is completed the
memo no longer appears.

Quests may have any number of submemos. These are located in gears associated with
the quest. The key for a submemo is "MEMO_" + QuestStatus. The QuestID is known
from the value stored in the gear. This memo only appears when QuestStatus holds
the specified value. These should be used when a subquest needs to add a memo but
shouldn't overwrite the main memo; most of these are used in entrance quests.
