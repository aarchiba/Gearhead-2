RANDOM METASCENE CONTENT

Requested during the map drawing process. Pregenerated maps cannot have random content.

Map content gears are actually plots. During the map drawing process, their elements
are selected and copied to the map along with personas and any scripts stored in the
gear itself.

Stored in the files "Series\RANCON_*.txt".


CONTEXT

Local scene context, type, desig, terrain, faction desig
Root scene desig, faction desig, personatype
World desig


DIFFERENCES FROM PLOTS

The elements can have two string attributes to describe the teams they should be placed
in. "TEAM[n]" gives the name of the team this element should be assigned to. This only
works if the existing teams are named, and a suitable team can be found. "TEAMDATA[n]"
is a standard team description string to be used if the named team cannot be found.

A door prototype may be included as a subcom, just as if the random scene content
were a map feature.

STANDARD TEAM NAMES

Citizens, Guards

REPLACEMENT STRINGS

The SAtts located in the content and its subcoms will have the following strings replaced:

  %id%		Replaced with content ID number
  %param%	Replaced with the provided parameter
  %1%..%8%	Replaced with the element ID numbers
		IMPORTANT: Don't try to access E1..E2, P-variables, \ELEMENT, or EScene
		in scene content! It's not a real plot and these things won't work! Use
		the %1%..%8% replacement strings for the same effect.
  %name1%..%name8%	The element names
  %pop%		Replaced with the label of the line displaced by this one in the megalist


REQUESTING CONTENT FROM MAPS AND MAP FEATURES

  [Fill|Some (n) (%)|Variety (min) (max)] [Here|Sub] [CONTENT TYPE] [CONTENT PARAMETER]

	FILL: Enough content will be added to use up all remaining cells.
	SOME: Up to n content frags will be added, % chance each.
	VARIETY: Between min and max frags will be added with no repetition.

	HERE: The content is added directly to the source map feature.
	SUB: The content is added to a new sub-zone of the map feature.


REQUESTING CONTENT FROM CONTENT

Often, a given piece of content will need more content to link to. The content request
is stored in the content gear in string attributes "CONTENT[x]". Required content should
be placed first in the list, and there should only be one required branch for any
given content.

  [OPTIONAL|REQUIRED] [CONTENT TYPE] [CONTENT PARAMETER] [LOCAL|DISTANT]



CONTENT LABELS

Combat/Social/Investigation 	- Describe the basic gist of the scene
Dynamic/Static			- Describe whether this is a metascene or a perminant scene


SUPERPROPS

Superprops are not the same as random scene content, but act similarly so here they are.
A superprop is a collection of props or other physical gears which are deployed on the
map in a specific pattern. For example:

	SuperProp
	requires <*EnemyBase>

Will load an "Enemy Base" superprop and assemble it in the parent map feature. The same context
used for random scene content will be used.

A superprop must be a subcom of a map feature. It will not function if simply placed as
an invcom of the scene.

May set Team1 to Team4. Depending on the superprop type, there may be several sub-groups into
which the prop is divided. For example, for a spaceship there may be engines, weapons,
and command sub-groups. If a specific team is not assigned, the team of the superprop request
is used.

Any scripts stored in the SuperProp request will be megalisted into all the component parts
as it is assembled.
