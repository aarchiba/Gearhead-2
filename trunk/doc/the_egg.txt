*****************************

A character's biography will be made up of two events, termed the FAMILY and
the BIO.

  FAMILY sets the home and mentor NPCs
  BIO sets the conflict

Since the BIO comes second, its options override those of the FAMILY.

DEFINING ATTRIBUTES
-------------------
A biography event may define several string attributes which affect the
adventure generation. Events which come later override events which come
earlier.

    CONTEXT:	This context is applied to the core story.
    CONFLICT:	This tag is applied to the end of egg-related quest requests
		(default: ".General")


DEFINING NPCS
-------------
A biography event may describe an NPC. If said NPC is a mentor, they will pass
on skill training to the PC. A biography event may only describe two mentors,
but arbitrarily many other NPCs.

All attributes of the NPC request will be copied to the eventual NPC.

The NPC may request a quest. Generally, the primary mentor will load a
"*EGG_Primary" quest and the secondary will load a "*EGG_Secondary" quest. If no
quest is explicitly requested, the NPC will be initialized with a "*EGG_Default"
quest.

The Age attribute of the NPC request is relative to the age of the PC, plus or
minus three years.


DEFINING RESIDENCE
------------------
A residence type can be defined using the "RESIDENCE <>" attribute. If no
residence is defined, a scene of type *EGG_RESIDENCE_Apartment will be used.

Following installation, the residence's designation will be changed to PCHOME.


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Each biography event should have a DESC attribute which contributes to the PC's
biography attribute. Several substitution strings may be included in this
description:
    %job%		The PC's job
    %job1%...%job[x]%	Jobs of the defined NPCs
    %name1%...		Names of the defined NPCs
    %sd%		Son/Daughter, as appropriate
