 When you start the game you will most likely have little more than the
 clothes you wear and a few credits for some basic equipment. Later on
 you will acquire new weapons, armor, and eventually the most prized item
 in this game world- a mecha. 
 
 In GearHead, Wargear is defined as any item which your PC owns but which
 is too heavy to be carried personally. Mecha fall into this category, as
 do mecha-scale weapons. To view, assign, and edit your wargear you'll
 need to use the Field HQ interface. This can be accessed through the
 View Character menu, or by pressing the 'H' key in exploration mode. 
 
 You will be presented with a list of your character's wargear. Selecting
 an item will bring you to a sub-menu, from which you can perform various
 actions depending upon the wargear's type and condition. 
 
INVENTORY MANAGEMENT 
 
 Every mecha has its own inventory and equipment lists, just like your PC
 has. To access a mecha's carried items you can select the View Inventory
 command 
 
 It is possible to trade items between mecha. Select the item you wish to
 trade, then choose the Transfer Item option. You will then be able to
 move the item to a different mecha. 
 
ALLOCATING ITEMS 
 
 When you buy a mecha-sized weapon at the store it does not go to your
 PC's inventory. To use the item you'll need to select it in the Field
 HQ, then transfer it to the mecha you want to equip it on. 
 
REPAIRING ITEMS 
 
 If a part is damaged you may want to try repairing it yourself instead
 of bringing it to the shop. Repair options will only be shown in the
 Field HQ if there is some damage that needs to be repaired, and if the
 PC knows the required skill. 
 
CUSTOMIZING YOUR MECHA 
 
 Selecting the Examine Parts option will bring up a complete list of all
 the components making up this mecha. To remove a part from your mecha,
 select it from the list and choose Remove Part. Not all parts can be
 removed: some parts are so integral to a design that they cannot be
 replaced. 
 
 If the removed part survived the extraction process, it will be placed
 in the mecha's inventory. 
 
 It is also possible to install components into a mecha. In order to be
 installed, the item must be located in the mecha's inventory. Select the
 item you want, and then choose the Install Part option. You will be
 presented with a list of legal installation slots, or an error message
 if the selected item cannot be installed. 
 
 While installing and removing components keep an eye on the stat display
 located above the parts list. This display will keep track of how your
 modifications affect the mecha's speed, maneuverability, and other
 statistics. You may want to try removing parts from one mecha, then
 transferring them to be installed on another. 
 
 In order to remove and install parts most effectively, your character
 should know the Mecha Engineering skill.
