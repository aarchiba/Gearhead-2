Persona Fragments

 These are little slices of conversation that can be inserted into persona
 gears semi-randomly. They are stored in the series directory in the
 files "PFRAG_*.txt".

CONTEXT
 - NPC character description
 - NPC mecha theme (if applicable) written as "[MTn]", where n is the theme number
 - Plot Context (if applicable)
 - Story Context (if plot is subcom of a story)
 - Scene Context (if plot is random scene content)
   - Local scene context, type, desig
   - Root scene desig, personatype, faction desig
   - World desig
 - Fragment type label
 - Designation + Type of NPC's faction, designation preceded with C:

 Fragments are selected if their "REQUIRES" string attribute matches the
 character description of the target NPC, the total context
 of the governing story (if appropriate), a type label provided when the
 fragment is requested, plus the designation and context of the NPC's faction.

 If generated as part of random scene content, the context includes
 the context list used by the content generator.

 The NPC's own faction designation is in quotes; in fact, this applies to
 all traits of the NPC.

 All persona fragments need a type label. All personas of a given type
 label should share the same interface.

 When inserted into a persona, the fragment is assigned an ID number.
 A fragment may use messages and variables in the range %id%00 to %id%99.
 To prevent conflict script lines used by persona fragments should be
 of the form ".%id%_[label]".

 A fragment may require up to eight parameters. These are strings which
 are inserted into the fragment in place of the symbols %1% to %8%. The
 parameters required by a given fragment vary by its type label.

Requesting a Persona Fragment

  *[script label] <[fragment type] [param1] [param2] ...>

 Any string attribute in a persona that starts with "*" will be interpreted
 as a fragment request. The "START" string attribute will be inserted into
 the persona in place of the fragment request, minus the *. All other lines
 will be copied directly.

 The first symbol in a fragment request will be the type label of the
 fragment type required. These type labels must always begin with "*".
 The next symbols will be parameters 1 through 8 to be inserted into
 the fragment. Parameter 1 is generally the script label to call
 when the fragment has been completed successfully.
